1. What is the difference between = and ==?

   =)- it is an assignment operator that assigns a value to a variable example is a = 6
(==)- it is an assigned operator that checks if the 2 experssions give the same value / identical




2. Can I leave out the colon in an if, while, or for statement? No




3. Should I use tab characters to indent my code? No, it is prefarable to use space character to indent my code.



4. Compose a program that takes three integer command-line arguments and writes 'equal' if all three are equal, and 'not equal' otherwise.

number1 =int(input('Please enter the first number:'))

number2 =int(input('Please enter the second number:'))

number3 =int(input('Please enter the third number:'))

if number1==number2==number3:
 print("Equal")
else:
 print("Not equal")




5. What is the value of j after each of the following code fragments is executed?
a. j = 0
for i in range (0, 10) :
j += i

b. j = 1
for i in range (0, 10) :
j += j

c. for j in range (0, 10) :
j += j

6. What are m and n after the following code is executed?
n = 123456789
m = 0
while n != 0:
m = (10 * m) + (n % 10)
n //= 10
print (m)
print (n)

7 What does this code do?
f = 0
g = 1
for i in range (0, 10):
f = f + g
g = f - g
print (f)

Bonus: Is there an example for when the following for and while loops are not equivalent?
for variable in range(start, stop):
statement1
statement2
...

variable = start
while variable < stop:
statement1
statement2
...
variable +=1
